### See the Deployment Applications section: Deployment_applications.md
The code for the relationship between the processed input data and the language structure is detailed in: **test_data_sample.ipynb**

We opened up some of our sample data, Code in: **data_sample.json**

In our online baseline analysis, we compared the performance of an XGBoost model against our FinLangNet model within the same dataset, matched by size with FinLangNet. Code in: **label_analysis.ipynb**
